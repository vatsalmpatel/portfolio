<p>In this project I created an object detection model to detect number plate on vehicles.

<h2 id="comment-toxicity--detection">Comment Toxicity 🧪 Detection<a href="#comment-toxicity--detection" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In todays day and age, there is a lot of toxicity on a lot (most) of social media platforms, and we need a way to flag those comments, blogs, text, news, e.t.c.. In order to do that, we can ask for a helping hand from a Machine Learning Model, that can classify comments, if they are toxic or not, and if they are what is the severity of the toxicity, i.e. threat, vulgar 🗣 and much more. We need a way to filter out negative comments and make a safe environment for everybody to enjoy.</p>

<p>In this project, I created a FastAPI application that takes a pretrained model to detect and segment cancer cells from an image and make predictions with the help of the model.</p>
<p>I have used FastAPI to create an endpoint (which is localhost in our case) which can be queried with Postman or in the Jupyter Notebook to visualize the predictions made by the model.</p>
<p>You need to choose an image and pass it to the model to make predictions.</p>

<h2 id="iris--detector-with-tensorflow-and-opencv">Iris 👁 Detector with TensorFlow and OpenCV<a href="#iris--detector-with-tensorflow-and-opencv" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In this project I created a TensorFlow model which can track eyes and project dots on my eyes 👀 as I move my to and away from the screen.</p>
<p>The model uses a pretrained ResNet model and I add more layers on top to train the model to track my eyes. I use images annotated with the point locations of my eye on a image. The annotation of images is done using LabelMe library in python and then the data is augmented using albumentations library.</p>

<h2 id="signature-detection-on-company-documents-">Signature Detection on Company Documents 📄<a href="#signature-detection-on-company-documents-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Now a days it is very common for law firms to have a digital record for every piece of paper they receive and it is essential for them to have signatures on each piece of paper they receive to keep track of who received what document because it could be something confidential related to a case that the firm might be working on.</p>
<p>So, instead of a human looking through each digital document, why not let the computer do the hard work in looking through each document and detect signatures in those images.</p>
<p>Created an entire end-to-end system by deploying the project on Azure and automating deployment on change with GitHub Actions.</p>

<h2 id="face-detection-with-tensorflow-">Face Detection with TensorFlow 👽<a href="#face-detection-with-tensorflow-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In this project, I worked upon creating a face detection appplication using TensorFlow. This application captures training images using your own webcam, saves them to a folder. Then you annotate those images using labelme library and use image augmentation using albumentations to augment those images and create more images for training. After this, I created a model using the Keras Functional API to create a model using VGG16 model architecture. Finally, I used this pre-trained model to detect my face in real-time.</p>

<p>In this example are going to look at Text Generation using the GPT2 model and Hugging Face 🤗. Using this model, we can generate paragraphs of text by just using a starting sentence.</p>

<h2 id="sign-language-detection-">Sign Language Detection 🤘<a href="#sign-language-detection-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>This is a Sign Language Detection Project 📽. What it does is detect hand-signs in realtime using OpenCV and TensorFlow LSTM Model. The current model is trained on detect &ldquo;I Love You ♥&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hello 👋&rdquo;, &ldquo;Thank You🎇&rdquo;, &ldquo;Volume Up 🔊&rdquo; and &ldquo;Volume Down 🔈&rdquo; hand signs.</p>
<p>Though, this can be modified to detect any handsigns and even body poses</p>

<h2 id="churn-prediction-using-machine-learning">Churn Prediction using Machine Learning<a href="#churn-prediction-using-machine-learning" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Churn is a metric of customer satisfaction. Low churn rate means that the customers are happy; and a higer churn rate means that the customers are no longer satisfied with the product/ business model and are leaving the company. This means churn rate can be very important. A small 🔽 in the churn rate can mean potentially 🔼 profits for the company.Churn is a good indicator of growth potential and machine learning can simplify the task and help you calculate customer churn rate.</p>

<h2 id="user-sentiment-analysis-using-transformers">User Sentiment Analysis using Transformers<a href="#user-sentiment-analysis-using-transformers" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In this example, we are gonna look at the BERT Transformer model from Hugging Face that will be used fro Sentiment Analysis.</p>
<p>The BERT Model is trained on product reviews from six languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>English</li>
<li>Dutch</li>
<li>German</li>
<li>French</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
<li>Italian</li>
</ul>
<p>We can leverage this trained model and use it very easily to get sentiments from reviews, I mean any reviews 🍾 from any of those 6 languages 💬.</p>

<h2 id="neural-style-transfer-using-tensorflow-">Neural Style Transfer using TensorFlow 🎨<a href="#neural-style-transfer-using-tensorflow-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Neural Style Transfer is a technique that takes two images, namelt, the content image and the style image and blend them both together so the output looks like the content image, but painted in the style of the style reference image. This is implemented with a pre-trained model fromTensorFlow Hub, that was trained to perform this kind of task. We just need to load the model and use the model to perform style transfer.</p>
