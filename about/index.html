<p>I am Vatsal Patel, currently pursuing my Masters of Science in Artificial Intelligence from Northeastern University.</p>
<p>From June 2022, I am doing a co-op at Retail Business Services (a company of Ahold Delhaize USA) as a Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Engineer. At Retail Business Services, I am responsible for building Recommender Systems using Machine Learning and Deep Learning to be able to recommend products to millions of customers who shop at brands such as Stop &amp; Shop, Giant Food, Food Lion and many other brands owned by Ahold Delhaize on the east coast.</p>
<p>As a Machine Learning and MLOps Engineer, I like to work on projects that include Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, Recommendation Engines, Data Engineering. I have experience in building end-to-end machine learning systems using a host of ML Models, containerizing them using Docker and deploying it on a Kubernetes Cluster using platforms such as Azure and Seldon. I also have a soft spot for automation building automation pipelines using Azure DevOps pipelines. As for cloud stack, I have worked with both Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS. I have a soft spot for Databricks, and how it has simplified life for programmers.</p>
<p>In 2021, I published a research paper named <strong><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353546682_Linear_Decision_Tree_Regressor_Decision_Tree_Regressor_Combined_with_Linear_Regressor">Linear Decison Tree Regressor</a></strong> where we developed a new machine learning algorithm for regression outperforming other regressors and overcame limitations of standard decision trees.</p>
<p>With my passion for ML algorithms, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and NLP I would love to be a part of the team that makes real advancements in AI and applies it practically that could affect the lives of millions around the world.</p>
<p><strong>I have a burning desire to keep on learning new stuff and I have no desire to stop, not right now, NEVER.</strong>.</p>

<p>P.S. I love to swim and play tennis and I am also a state level Table Tennis Champion ðŸ˜‰ back in India.</p>
